# SA2

In this assignment, I created a frontend starter pack using Vite. The pack uses npm and node as the dependency package manager, and Vite as the processor and builder for the dev environment and production. Further, the pack also employs ESlist to check for syntax errors and Sass for styling.

## What Worked Well
  Everything worked smoothly!
## What Didn't
  I had a small error where it said 'vite-plugin-eslint' was an unresolved reference but I quickly resolved this through installing it. 
## Extra Credit
  I installed NVM. See screenshot below for an example of me using it. I also installed a Vite plugin for favicon (vite-plugin-favicons-inject). (see Vite config file and dev dependencies in package.json)
